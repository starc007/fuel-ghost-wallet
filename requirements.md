# Fuel Privacy Wallet Requirements

The Fuel Privacy Wallet is a browser-based cryptocurrency wallet designed to enhance user privacy while interacting with decentralized applications (dApps) on the Fuel network. Unlike traditional wallets that expose a single address for all interactions, this wallet generates unique addresses for each dApp, preventing cross-application tracking and maintaining user privacy.

## Key Features

1. PassKey Integration

   - Replaces traditional seed phrases with PassKeys for enhanced security and user experience
   - Enables seamless authentication using device biometrics or security keys
   - Eliminates the risk of seed phrase loss or theft

2. Address Management

   - Creates unique, deterministic addresses for each dApp interaction
   - Maintains a private mapping between dApps and their respective addresses
   - Ensures transactions from one dApp cannot be linked to interactions with other dApps

3. Transaction Handling

   - Securely signs transactions using PassKey-derived credentials
   - Monitors balances across all generated addresses
   - Manages gas fees efficiently across multiple addresses

4. Security
   - Implements client-side encryption for all sensitive data
   - Uses browser's secure storage for encrypted wallet information
   - Ensures private keys never leave the user's device

## Privacy Features

1. Address Isolation

   - Each dApp receives a unique address
   - No visible connection between different addresses
   - Prevents cross-dApp activity tracking

2. Security Architecture

   - Encryption of all stored data
   - Zero seed phrase exposure
   - Private key separation per dApp

3. User Experience
   - Simple PassKey-based login
   - Automatic address management
   - Seamless dApp interactions

## Implementation Approach

The wallet uses a combination of modern web technologies and cryptographic principles:

1. PassKey Management

   - WebAuthn for biometric/security key authentication
   - Client-side key derivation
   - Secure storage of encrypted wallet data

2. Address Generation

   - Deterministic derivation from dApp identifiers
   - Cryptographic separation between addresses
   - Efficient key management without seed phrases

3. Privacy Protection
   - No central address registry
   - Independent transaction paths
   - Isolated dApp interactions

The wallet prioritizes both security and usability, making it suitable for both novice and advanced users while maintaining strong privacy guarantees.
